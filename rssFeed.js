        <article>
            <p>
              The <b>Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board</b> clarifies to candidates the only way to check the 2024 UTME results, 
              contrary to the claims circulating on social media, where some individuals are flaunting printed result slips.
            </p>
            <p>
              In previous years, candidates could access their results through the Boardâ€™s website. 
              However, the procedure for checking the 2024 UTME results has changed; unlike before, 
              the results  <b><em>are not available</em></b>  in hard format currently and <b><em>cannot not be accessed</em></b> on the Boardâ€™s website.
              Candidates are advised to be wary of any person who makes such a claim.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Board instructs the public that the only way to check the 2024 UTME results is by sending <b class="sending-UTME">â€˜UTMERESULTâ€™ to 55019 or 66019</b>  
              using the same phone number that the candidate used for UTME registration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Additionally, candidates wishing to access services provided by the Board, other than the UTME, 
                  must create a profile by sending their NIN to 55019 or 66019 from the phone number they intend to use for all Board-related communications.
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the public is advised to avoid using third-party services for result retrieval and is urged to follow the method specified by the Board to access results.
