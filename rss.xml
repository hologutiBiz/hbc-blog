            <p>The <b>Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board</b> clarifies to candidates the only way to check the 2024 UTME results, contrary to the claims circulating on social media, where some individuals are flaunting printed result slips.</p>
            <p>In previous years, candidates could access their results through the Boardâ€™s website. However, the procedure for checking the 2024 UTME results has changed; unlike before, the results  <b><em>are not available</em></b>  in hard format currently and <b><em>cannot not be accessed</em></b> on the Boardâ€™s website. Candidates are advised to be wary of any person who makes such a claim.</p>
            <p>The Board instructs the public that the only way to check the 2024 UTME results is by sending <b class="sending-UTME">â€˜UTMERESULTâ€™ to 55019 or 66019</b>  using the same phone number that the candidate used for UTME registration.</p>
            <p><i>Additionally, candidates wishing to access services provided by the Board, other than the UTME, must create a profile by sending their NIN to 55019 or 66019 from the phone number they intend to use for all Board-related communications.</i></p>
            <p>Therefore, the public is advised to avoid using third-party services for result retrieval and is urged to follow the method specified by the Board to access results.</p>

              <h1>CAC Provides Additional Way for Bank and Fintech to Navigate the Agents Registration Process</h1>
            </div>
            <article>
              <p> In a significant move to streamline the operations of financial technology (fintech) services, the <b>Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)</b> has mandated all bank and fintech Point of Sale (POS) agents to register as business entities. This directive, issued earlier this month, aims to formalize the rapidly growing sector, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.</p>
              <p>Understanding the potential complexities this new requirement may introduce, the <abbr title="Corporate Affairs Commission">CAC</abbr> has thoughtfully provided alternative means for registration, thereby simplifying the process for agents. According to a recent statement released by the Commission, <q>in order to ease compliance with this directive, the Commission has deployed alternative platforms for quick registration of the Agents.</q></p>
              <div class="options-wrapper">
                <span class="two-distinct">The alternatives presented offer two distinct options for registration:</span>
                <p><b class="option">Option 1</b> <br>outlines a more traditional approach, where customers can download the Business Name Registration form, make the necessary payments through Remita, and submit the required documents via email to <a href="mailto:quickservice@cac.gov.ng">quickservice@cac.gov.ng</a>. It's important to note that by choosing this option, <q>you also consent that CAC may alter your proposed name(s) where necessary to ensure approval</q>, should there be any issues with the submitted names.</p>
                <p><b class="option">Option 2</b> <br> leverages technology to expedite the process, allowing customers to collaborate with their fintech institutions, which can handle name reservation and registration through API integrations with the <abbr title="Corporate Affairs Commission">CAC</abbr> portal. This method is touted as <q>the fastest and most convenient for end-users</q>, streamlining the process significantly.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Commission's proactive approach in providing these alternatives before the registration deadline of <time datetime="2024-07-07">7th July 2024</time> demonstrates a commitment to fostering a supportive environment for fintech operations while maintaining the necessary oversight.</p>
              <p>For fintech POS agents, this development represents a crucial step towards greater legitimacy and operational efficiency. It also reflects the broader trend of digital transformation within the Nigerian financial sector, where technology is increasingly being harnessed to improve services and regulatory compliance.</p>
              <p>As the deadline approaches, agents are encouraged to evaluate both options and choose the one that best suits their needs, ensuring a smooth transition into compliance with the <abbr title="Corporate Affairs Commission">CAC's</abbr> directives. The future of fintech in Nigeria is bright, and these measures are a testament to the country's dedication to nurturing a robust and responsible digital economy.</p>

              <p>The dream of homeownership can feel distant for many Nigerians, particularly those in the low-and middle-income brackets. However, a recent initiative by the Federal Government of Nigeria offers a beacon of hope. The <q>Renewed Hope Estates and Cities</q> program, launched by the <i>Ministry of Housing and Urban Development</i> under <i><b>Arc. Ahmed Musa Dangiwa</b></i>, aims to bridge the housing gap and make owning a home a more achievable reality.</p>
              <p>The program recognizes the significant housing deficit in Nigeria. With <b>100,000</b> new housing units planned for construction across all <b>36 states</b> and the <b>FCT</b>, the initiative seeks to make a substantial impact. The variety of ownership options offered further strengthens its reach. Homeowners can choose from outright purchase, mortgage financing, or a rent-to-own scheme, catering to diverse financial circumstances.</p>
              <p>A commendable aspect of the program is its specific focus on low- and mid-income earners. This segment of the population has often faced significant challenges in securing affordable housing. The <q>Renewed Hope Estates and Cities</q> program extends a helping hand to both Nigerians residing within the country and those living abroad.</p>
              <p>
                <span class="access">Accessibility</span><br>
                The program's transparency is a positive step. Nigerians interested in participating in the program can visit the official portal, <a href="https://renewedhopehomes.fmhud.gov.ng" target="_blank" class="link-to-renewedHope">renewedhopehomes.fmhud.gov.ng</a>, to explore available options, eligibility requirements, and application procedures. The application allows for easy access to information and potentially simplifies the application process. This online platform can be crucial for those seeking clarity on eligibility criteria and application procedures.
              </p>
              <p>While the program is still in its early stages, it has the potential to be a significant force for positive change in Nigeria's housing market. Increased access to affordable housing can contribute to greater social stability and economic growth.</p>
              <p>The  <q>Renewed Hope Estates and Cities</q> presents a promising opportunity for many Nigerians to achieve their dream of homeownership. Let's hope it lives up to its name and ushers in a new era of accessible housing for the nation.</p>
              <p>
                <span class="informing">Staying Informed</span> <br>  
                As the program unfolds, it's important to stay informed about updates, eligibility requirements, and the application process. We can expect more details to emerge in the coming days and weeks. Following more reliable sources, such as the Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development website, will be key.</p>
